# Getting Started

The btptf CLI offers two ways to export BTP resources:

- Exporting resources via JSON (recommended)
- Exporting resources

Let's look at how both flows work for a simple subaccount export.

## Option 1: Basic Flow to Export a Subaccount via JSON (Recommended)
This is a two-step process where a JSON is created as a resource inventory and used as a basis for the export.

1. Create a JSON file with a list of BTP resources to be exported.

    ```bash
    btptf create-json - s <subaccount id>
    ```
Review and adjust the JSON file according to your needs.

2. Export resources from SAP BTP via a JSON file.

    ```bash
    btptf export-by-json -p <path to json file>
    ```

## Option 2: Basic Flow to Export a Subaccount Directly

Export resources from SAP BTP directly, by specifying their IDs.

    ```bash
    btptf export -s <subaccount id>
    ```

You find a comprehensive overview of the commands and their options and flags in the [documentation](btptf.md).

## Option 1: Detailed Example of Exporting a Subaccount via JSON

The below example looks in more detail at how to use the btptf CLI to export an existing subaccount as  Terraform configuration and state.

1. Launch SAP BTP Cockpit and navigate to an existing subaccount.

2. In the subaccount, navigate to the 'Overview' tab and find the 'Subaccount ID'

3. Open a terminal session.

4. Generate the json file which contains the list of resources to be exported. This json file can be generated by running the btptf CLI command btptf create-json - s <subaccount id>

    ```bash
    btptf create-json - s <YOUR SUBACCOUNT ID>
    ```
    The resources list file with the name btpResources_<subaccount id>.json e.g, `btpResources_<YOUR SUBACCOUNT ID>.json` gets generated.

5. Edit the json file and remove the resources which need not be exported and managed by Terraform.

6. Run the btptf CLI command to export Terraform configuration using the JSON file.

    ```bash
    btptf export-by-json -s <YOUR SUBACCOUNT ID>
    ```

    As the JSON file is generated with the default name you do not need to to explicitly specify it.

7. The Terraform configurations will be generated under the folder `generated_configurations_<YOUR SUBACCOUNT ID>`. The output of the command will show an export summary which contains the information about which 'Resource Names' and their respective count.

8. Review the file NextSteps.md under the folder `generated_configurations_<YOUR SUBACCOUNT ID>` and adapt the Terraform configuration files as mentioned in the document.

9. In the terminal, navigate to the folder `generated_configurations_<YOUR SUBACCOUNT ID>` and run the `terraform plan` command. This will show a plan of how many resources will be imported, added, changed and destroyed.

10. Run the command Terraform apply. This will import the Terraform state and store it in the terraform.state file in under the folder `generated_configurations_<YOUR SUBACCOUNT ID>`.

11.  Now, to modify your BTP resources in this subaccount you can change to Terraform configuration files and run a Terraform apply to trigger the changes.
